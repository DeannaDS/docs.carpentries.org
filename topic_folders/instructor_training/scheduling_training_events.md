### Scheduling Training Events

Instructor Training events, bonus modules, and teaching demos are scheduled on a quarterly basis [as described here](../communications/guides/community_events.md). Four times a year, the Core Team will poll Trainers for their availability to teach Instructor Training. At the same time, Trainers will be asked to sign up to host teaching demos using Calendly.    

The Core Team creates a training calendar by matching up availability of Trainers. Once the training calendar is confirmed, it is posted [Member information page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/).  Member sites each receive a unique registration code allowing their team members to sign up for these events. 

Teaching demos are listed on the [teaching demo etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos).  Trainees can sign up for teaching demos at any time.
