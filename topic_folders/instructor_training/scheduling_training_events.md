### Scheduling Training Events

Instructor Training events are scheduled on a quarterly basis.  

Once the calendar is confirmed, it is posted [Member information page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/).  Member sites each receive a unique registration code allowing their team members to sign up for these events.
