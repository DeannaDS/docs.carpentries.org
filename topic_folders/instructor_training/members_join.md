Certified Instructors can co-teach [Carpentries workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) here at [ site name ], helping us reach more people and build these skills across our community. In addition, Carpentries Instructors also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. Hosting institutions cover travel and expenses for volunteer Instructors teaching workshops in-person.

[Service as a Carpentries Instructor is a voluntary activity. This service can support existing work responsibilities in a variety of roles. It also represents an opportunity for career development. Carpentries Instructors are sought after in a variety of academic and professional teaching roles. Participation as an Instructor builds skills as well as a track record in teaching while expanding your professional network.]

The Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training.
