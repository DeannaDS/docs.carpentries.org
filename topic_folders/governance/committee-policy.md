## The Carpentries Committee Policy

As per The Carpentries Bylaws, 
[Committees](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees-and-task-forces) are 
organised either by the Executive Council or the Core Team to carry out specific tasks on an ongoing and 
longer-term basis. Committees are an integral part of The Carpentries community and play an important role in how 
the community advances towards its goals and fulfills its mission; some examples 
include the [Code of Conduct Committee](https://carpentries.org/coc-ctte/), 
various Lesson Program Governance Committees and Curriculum Advisory Committees, 
the [Lesson Infrastructure Committee](https://carpentries.org/lesson-infra/),
and the [Instructor Development Committee](https://carpentries.org/inst-dev/), 
the [Trainer Leadership Committee](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md).
