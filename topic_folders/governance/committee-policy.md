## The Carpentries Committee Policy

See the definition of a [committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees)
in the Bylaws. 

### Context
This policy defines the operational processes and the lines of communication to and from a committee 
to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability of the committee's activities.

### Committee Formation
A committees is formed by creating the public documentation described below and submitting it for approval. 
If a committee is proposed or led by the Core Team, the formal 
approval of the Executive Council is not needed and the Executive Council should only be informed. In all other cases, 
the Executive Council approves the committee. 
Upon approval, the committee is listed at [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/) 
with a link to its public documentation.

### Committee Operations 
The following are operational guidelines for committees.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Each committee should:
* Appoint a committee chair, and optionally a co-chair
* Identify term limits and succession plan for chair/co-chair
* Provide a “Roles and Responsibilities” document for the committee and its members
* Identify processes for on-boarding new members
* Identify a process for off-boarding members
* Include a process for recruiting and selecting new members
* Appoint a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend committee meetings
* Prepare periodical written reports to the Executive Council with an agreed frequency (e.g. quarterly, biannually or annually). 
The agreed frequency of reporting can be revised in agreement with the Executive Council during the lifetime of the committee.

#### Meetings
Each committee should:
* Hold regular meetings (e.g. quarterly or biannually)
* Post meetings on the community calendar. Note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to public to attend. 
For example, for the Code of Conduct Committee, only business meetings are public but not the incident meetings
* Aim to host at least one community discussion per year to let the community know about the committee's activities.

#### Communication
Each committee should:
* Post meeting notes or minutes in a consistent location. Minutes should be public unless the work of 
the committee requires them to remain private
* Utilise [The Carpentries communication](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) 
pathways to engage with the community - e.g. community calendar, community discussions, etc.
* Communicate with their Core Team liaison on a regular basis 
* Produce periodic written reports to the Executive Council 

#### Public Documentation
Each committee should have a public page with the following information:

* Committee name
* A short description of what the committee does
* Contact information for the committee
* Link to the committee's "Roles and responsibilities" document
* Link to the committee's public materials - e.g. the committee’s GitHub repository, the relevant section of the 
Handbook (if available)
* Information on when the committee meetings are held
* Link to the public meeting notes (if available)
* Names of the current members including their roles
* Names of the past members including their roles
* Name of the Core Team liaison person
* Information on how to join the committee

The committee chair is responsible for keeping the public documentation up to date.

#### Internal Documentation
A committee should have internal documentation for its members that includes:

* On-boarding information
* Off-boarding information
* How the chair and other roles are selected
* Information on recruiting or selecting committee members: e.g. language, rubric, etc.

Whenever possible, this internal documentation should be made available to the community.

### Committee Actions Requiring Executive Council Approval
A committee will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:

* Creation of a supplementary Code of Conduct
* Creation and/or release of position statements
* Hosting branded events
* Creation and/or use a logo **comment: which logo? The Carpentries logo?**
* Launching an own fundraising campaign

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. Committees should consult with the Core Team (in the first instance) or the 
Executive Council if there is any question about whether or not what they are doing requires approval.

### Committee Termination
A committee may naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its role, in which case the Executive Council 
should be notified. The Core Team may terminate committees that it had approved. 
Executive Council may terminate any committee at any time if the committee is not deemed 
necessary any more.

### Past & Current Committees
