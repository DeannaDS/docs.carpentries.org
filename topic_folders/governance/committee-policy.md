## The Carpentries Committee Policy

See the definition of a [committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees)
in the Bylaws. 

This policy defines the operational processes and the lines of communication to and from a committee 
to ensure transparency, accountability and sustainability of the committee's activities.

### Committee Formation
A committee is initiated by outlining a [proposal](#committee-proposal) (described below) and following the approval procedure:

- Committee proposals by the Executive Council are approved implicitly. 
- Committee proposals by the Core Team do not require a formal approval of the Executive Council and the Executive Council should only be informed.
- Committee proposals by community members need to be initially endorsed and approved by [the Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) 
and the Executive Council informed. If the Core Team feels that the proposal cannot be accepted immediately and needs further discussions by the Executive Council, 
the Executive Director can bring it to the Executive Council's attention.

Upon approval, the committee is listed at [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/) 
with a link to its public documentation.

#### Committee Proposal
A committee proposal should:
- explain the need for the committee
- explain why it should be an on-going/longer-term project 
- list aims and objectives of the committee

### Committee Operations 
The following are operational guidelines for committees.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Each committee should:

* Appoint a committee chair, and, optionally, a co-chair
* Identify term limits for chair/co-chair/standard members 
* Provide a public “Roles and Responsibilities” document for the committee and its members
* Create internal documentation (which may be made public), including:
  * Process for recruiting and selecting new members
  * Process for on-boarding new members
  * Process for off-boarding members
  * A succession plan for chair/co-chair
  * Decision making process
* Appoint a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend committee meetings
* Prepare written reports to the Executive Council with an agreed frequency (e.g. quarterly, biannually or annually). 
The frequency of reporting can be adjusted by the Executive Council during the lifetime of the committee.

#### Meetings
Each committee should:

* Hold regular meetings (at least twice a year).
* Post meetings on the community calendar. Note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to public to attend. 
For example, for the Code of Conduct Committee, only business meetings are public but not the incident meetings.
* Aim to host at least one community discussion per year to let the community know about the committee's activities.

#### Communication
Each committee should:

* Post meeting notes or minutes in a consistent location. Minutes should be public unless the work of 
the committee requires them to remain private.
* Utilise [The Carpentries communication](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) 
pathways to engage with the community - e.g. community calendar, community discussions, etc.
* Communicate with their Core Team liaison on a regular basis. 
* Produce periodic written reports to the Executive Council. 

#### Public Documentation
Each committee should have a public page with the following information:

* Committee name
* A short description of what the committee does, including its aims and objectives as outlined in the [committee proposal](#committee-proposal)
* Contact information for the committee
* Link to the committee's "Roles and Responsibilities" document
* Link to the committee's other public materials (if available) - e.g. the committee’s GitHub repository, the relevant section of the 
Handbook, etc. 
* Information on when the committee meetings are held
* Link to the public meeting notes (if available)
* Names of the current members including their roles
* Names of the past members including their roles
* Name of the Core Team liaison person
* Information on how to apply to join the committee

The committee chair is responsible for keeping the public documentation up to date. This documentation can, for example, 
be hosted under [Carpentries Committees repository on GitHub](https://github.com/carpentries/committees).

### Committee Actions Requiring Executive Council Approval
A committee will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:

* Any modifications to the Code of Conduct
* Creation and/or release of position statements
* Hosting Carpentries-branded events
* Modifications of The Carpentries logos (refer to the [Carpentries Logo Usage Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/logos.html))
* Launching an own fundraising campaign

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. Committees should consult the Core Team (in the first instance) or the 
Executive Council if there is any question about whether or not what they are doing requires approval.

### Committee Termination
A committee may naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its role, in which case the Executive Council 
should be notified. The Core Team may terminate committees that it had approved. 
Executive Council may terminate any committee at any time.
