## The Carpentries Task Force Policy

As per The Carpentries Bylaws,
[Task Forces](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees-and-task-forces) are
organised either by the Executive Council or the Core Team to carry out specific tasks on a short-term basis 
(a year or less), e.g. to organise an event or info gathering for another decision or challenge.

###  Context
The Carpentries uses Task Forces to explore ideas and make updates in policy, procedures and guidelines. 
Task forces bring together a small group of people focused on a particular topic for a set period of time. 
Task Forces can be proposed by the community, Lesson Programs, [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) or 
Executive Council, and are approved by the Executive Council.

### Task Force Operations
To ensure sustainability, accountability and effective communication for all Task Forces, we propose the following guidelines.

#### Meetings
Each Task Force should:
* hold regular meetings, to be determined by the Task Force Chair
* post meetings on the community calendar. Note that meetings do not necessarily need to be public

#### Requirements
Each Task Force requires:
* a [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md) that outlines the context, objectives and deliverables of the Task Force
* a set timeline for the start and completion of the Task Force deliverables
* an associated public facing GitHub project for information about the Task Force during its work, to be located in the [Carpentries Task Forces GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces)
* appointment of a Task Force chair
* a “roles and responsibilities” document for the Task Force
* a process for recruiting and selecting Task Force members
* appointment of a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) liaison who serves as a point of contact and can attend Task Force meetings when deemed necessary

#### Communication
Each Task Force should:
* post meeting notes or minutes in the corresponding task force folder in the Task Force's GitHub repository. Minutes should be public, but can be private if the work of the Task Force requires it
* utilise The Carpentries [communication pathways](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html)
* produce a Task Force report to be shared with the Executive Council upon completion of the deliverables as outlined in the Task Force Charter

### Public Documentation
Each Task Force shall have a folder in the [Carpentries Task Forces GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) with the following information:
* [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md)
* Meeting notes or minutes
* Task Force report 

The Task Force chair is responsible for updating this information as necessary.

### Internal Documentation
Each Task Force should have internal documentation for the members that includes:
* Onboarding information
* Offboarding information
* How the chair and other roles are selected
* Information on recruiting or selecting task force members: e.g. language, rubric

Whenever possible, this internal documentation should be made available to the community.

#### Task Force Formation
The current mechanism for creation of a Task Force is for the Executive Council or [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) to identify needs for information gathering or updates in current policies, guidelines or products, and collaboratively draft a Charter with relevant members of the community. Members of the community interested in proposing or leading a Task Force should get in touch with the Executive Council at carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org. The Task Force comes into effect upon approval of the Task Force Charter by the Executive Council.

#### Task Force Termination
The Executive Council may terminate a Task Force at any time.

#### Task Force Actions Requiring Executive Council Approval
The Task Force will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:
* Creation of a supplementary Code of Conduct
* Creation and/or release of position statements
* Host branded events
* Create and/or use a logo
* Launch its own fundraising campaign

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. Task Forces should consult with the Executive Council if there is any 
question about whether or not what they are doing requires approval.
