## The Carpentries Task Force Policy

See the definition of [Task Forces](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees-and-task-forces)
in the Bylaws. 

###  Context
This policy defines the operational processes and the lines of communication to and from a task force
to ensure transparency, accountability and effectiveness the task force's activities.

### Task Force Formation
A task force is formed by submitting a Task Force Charter (explained [below](#task-force-charter)) for approval to
the Executive Council. If a task force is proposed or lead by the Core Team, the formal
approval of the Executive Council is not needed and the Executive Council should only be informed by the Core Team.
Upon approval, the task force is listed at [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/)
with a link to its public Charter.

### Task Force Operations
The following are operational guidelines for task forces.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Each task force should:
* Provide a [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md)
  that outlines the context, objectives and deliverables of the task force
* Set a timeline for the start and completion of the task force's deliverables
* Appoint a task force chair, and optionally a co-chair, with a description of their roles and responsibilities
* Provide a “Roles and Responsibilities” document for the task force

#### Meetings
Each task force should:
* Hold regular meetings, to be determined by the Task Force Chair

#### Communication
Each task force should:
