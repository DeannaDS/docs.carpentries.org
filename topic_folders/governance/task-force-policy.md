## The Carpentries Task Force Policy

See the definition of a [Task Force](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees-and-task-forces)
in the Bylaws. 

This policy defines the operational processes and the lines of communication to and from a task force
to ensure transparency, accountability and effectiveness the task force's activities.

### Task Force Formation                                             
A task force is initiated by submitting a [task force charter proposal](#task-force-charter-proposal) and abiding to the following the approval procedure:

- Task force proposals by the Executive Council are approved implicitly.
- Task force proposals by the Core Team do not require a formal approval of the Executive Council and the Executive Council should only be informed.
- Task force proposals by community members need to be submitted to the [Core Team](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
  If the Core Team endorses and approves the proposal, the Executive Council is informed of this decision. If the Core 
Team feels that the proposal requires the Executive Council's review, 
the Executive Director can bring the proposal to the Executive Council's attention.

Upon approval, the task force is assigned a folder in the 
[Task Forces repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) and can be 
listed on [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/) with a link to its public documentation.

#### Task Force Charter Proposal
A task force charter proposal should follow the [Task Force Charter template](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md) 
and provide the following information:

- explain the need for or context of the task force
- list aims and objectives of the task force
- set a timeline for the start and completion of the task force's activities/deliverables

A proposal can be submitted by opening an issue in the [Task Force's repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces)
or via email to the appropriate group as per the [task formation guidelines](#task-force-formation). 

### Task Force Operations
The following are operational guidelines for task forces.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Each task force should:
- Create the official [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md) after the proposal is approved
- Appoint a task force chair, and, optionally, a co-chair
- Provide a public “Roles and Responsibilities” document for the task force and its members
- Have a public-facing folder in the [Carpentries Task Forces Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) to store the Task Force Charter and all relevant public information about the task force
- Create internal documentation (which may be made public), including:
  - Process for recruiting and selecting new members
  - Decision making process
- Appoint a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend committee meetings, and
  communicate with the liaison on a regular basis
- Meetings and communication:
  - Organise regular meetings to progress with the task force's activities and post meeting notes or minutes in a consistent location (meeting notes or minutes should be public unless the work of the task force requires them to remain private)
  - Post meetings in the community calendar (note that meetings do not necessarily need to be open to public to attend - for example, the Code of Conduct Committee's
    business meetings are public but the incident meetings are not)
  - Utilise other [Carpentries community communication pathways](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html) to engage with the community as needed
- Prepare a written report to the Executive Council upon completion of the task force's activities/deliverables as outlined in its charter

#### Public Documentation
Each task force should have a public-facing folder in the 
[Carpentries Task Forces GitHub Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) with the following information:

- [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md)
- Contact information for the task force
- Link to the public meeting notes or minutes (if available)
- Names and roles of the task force members
- Name of the Core Team liaison person
- The task force report to the Executive Council (once produced)

The task force chair is responsible for keeping the public documentation up to date.

#### Actions Requiring Executive Council Approval
A task force will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:

- Any modifications to the Code of Conduct
- Creation and/or release of position statements
- Host Carpentries-branded events
- Any modifications of The Carpentries logos (refer to the [Carpentries Logo Usage Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/logos.html))
- Launch an own fundraising campaign

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. In the case of any ambiguity, task forces should consult the Core Team (in the first instance) or the
Executive Council to clarify if things they plan to do require approval.

### Task Force Termination
A task force will naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its role. 
The Core Team may terminate task forces that it had approved.
Executive Council may terminate any task force at any time.

### Past & Current Task Forces
The following is a list of some community task forces:

- [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://carpentries.org/carp-con-tf/) - a recurring task force that gets periodically 
reformed to organise the international [CarpentryCon](https://carpentries.org) conference on behalf of The Carpentries
- Other task force examples can be found in [The Carpentries Task Force Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces)
