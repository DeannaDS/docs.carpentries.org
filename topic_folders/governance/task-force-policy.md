## The Carpentries Task Force Policy

See the definition of [Task Forces](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#committees-and-task-forces)
in the Bylaws. 

###  Context
This policy defines the operational processes and the lines of communication to and from a task force
to ensure transparency, accountability and effectiveness the task force's activities.

### Task Force Formation
A task force is formed by submitting a Task Force Charter (explained [below](#roles-and-responsibilities)) to the Executive Council 
for approval. If a task force is proposed by the Core Team, a formal approval of the Executive Council 
is not necessary and the Executive Council should only be informed.
Upon approval, the task force is listed at [The Carpentries website](https://carpentries.org/committees/)
with a link to its public Charter.

### Task Force Operations
The following are operational guidelines for task forces.

#### Roles and Responsibilities
Each task force should:
* Provide a [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md)
that outlines the context, objectives and deliverables of the task force
* Set a timeline for the start and completion of the task force's deliverables
* Appoint a task force chair, and optionally a co-chair
* Provide a “Roles and Responsibilities” document for the committee and its members  (** comment: do we need this? it was not there in the original text in the Handbook**)
* Identify processes for recruiting and selecting task force members
* Create a public-facing folder for the task force in the [Carpentries Task Forces Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces), 
to store the Task Force Charter and all relevant information about the task force during its existence
* Appoint a [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/) member liaison to serve as a point of contact and (optionally) attend task force meetings

#### Meetings
Each task force should:
* Hold regular meetings, to be determined by the task force chair
* Post meetings on the community calendar (note that meetings do not necessarily need to be public)

#### Communication
Each task force should:
* Post meeting notes or minutes in a consistent location. Minutes should be public unless the work of
  the committee requires them to remain private
* Utilise [The Carpentries communication](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/index.html)
  pathways to engage with the community - e.g. community calendar, community discussions, etc.
* Produce a report for the Executive Council upon completion of the deliverables outlined in the Task Force Charter

### Public Documentation
Each task force shall have a public-facing folder in the 
[Carpentries Task Forces GitHub Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces) with the following information:

* [Task Force Charter](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/master/task-force-charter-template.md)
* Contact information for the task force
* Task force meeting notes or minutes
* Names of the task force members, including their roles
* Name of the Core Team liaison person
* Task force report to the Executive Council (once produced)

The task force chair is responsible for keeping the public documentation up to date.

### Internal Documentation
A task force should have internal documentation for its members that includes:

** comment: does task force need all this info as it may only last for 3-6 months? looks like this was copied from the committee policy **

* Onboarding information
* Offboarding information
* How the chair and other roles are selected
* Information on recruiting or selecting task force members: e.g. language, rubric

Whenever possible, this internal documentation should be made available to the community.

#### Task Force Termination
A task force will naturally cease to function upon fulfilling its role. 
The Executive Council may terminate a task force at any time if the task force is not deemed
necessary any more.

#### Task Force Actions Requiring Executive Council Approval
The task force will not undertake any of the following actions without obtaining approval of the Executive Council:

* Creation of a supplementary Code of Conduct
* Creation and/or release of position statements
* Hosting branded events
* Creation and/or use a logo **comment: which logo? The Carpentries logo?**
* Launching an own fundraising campaign

Note that the above list is not exhaustive. Committees should consult with the Core Team or the
Executive Council if there is any question about whether or not what they are doing requires approval.

### Past & Current Task Forces
Some examples of task forces include the [CarpentryCon Task Force](https://carpentries.org/carp-con-tf/), 
which gets regularly reformed to organise the international CarpentryCon conference on behalf of The Carpentries. 
Other examples can be found in [The Carpentries Task Force Repository](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces), e.g. see 
the [Value Alignment Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/tree/main/2021/Values-Alignment).
