## Curriculum Advisory Committees

Curriculum Advisors are part of a team that provides the oversight, vision, and leadership for a particular set of lessons.
The division of responsibilities between Curriculum Advisors and Maintainers is detailed 
in [this consultation rubric](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/cac-consult-rubric.html).

Curriculum Advisors represent The Carpentries community and should strive to embody The Carpentries philosophy by:

- Recognising the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:
  -  Finding what is good. 
  -  Being specific about improvements needed. 
  -  Using motivational language.
- Evaluating lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries pedagogical model:
  - Teaching what is most relevant and useful for learners.
  - Avoiding getting bogged down in technical details.
  - Keeping language motivating.
  - Emphasising the importance of continued learning and improvement.

### Meetings
Each Curriculum Advisory Committee will meet at least quarterly, and preferably every two months. These meetings are the primary avenue through which CAC members will interact, and should follow best practices for The Carpentries meetings, including having meeting roles, taking notes, and creating and holding a space for everyone to contribute. CAC members should prepare for meetings by reading and contributing to relevant documents in advance of the meeting. 

A detailed workflow for Curriculum Advisory Committee meetings, including email templates, is available as a [meeting checklist](CAC_meeting_checklist.md).

#### Meeting Minutes
Meetings minutes are available in the committee's GitHub repository:

- [Data Carpentry Curriculum Advisors repo](https://github.com/datacarpentry/curriculum-advisors)
- [Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisors repo](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors)
