## Lesson Development Roles

### Curriculum Advisory Committees

Curriculum Advisors are part of a team that provides the oversight, vision, and leadership for a particular set of lessons. Advisors represent The Carpentries community and should strive to embody The Carpentries philosophy by:

- Recognising the importance of communication and being welcoming to all contributors.
- Giving feedback to contributors using The Carpentries model:
- Find what is good. Be specific about improvements needed. Use motivational language.
- Evaluating lesson contributions in light of The Carpentries pedagogical model:
- Teach what is most relevant and useful for learners.
- Avoid getting bogged down in technical details.
- Keep language motivating.
- Emphasise the importance of continued learning and improvement.

#### Meetings
Each Curriculum Advisory Committee will meet at least quarterly, and preferably every two months. These meetings are the primary avenue through which CAC members will interact, and should follow best practices for The Carpentries meetings, including having meeting [roles](#meeting-roles), taking notes, and creating and holding a space for everyone to contribute. CAC members should prepare for meetings by reading and contributing to relevant documents in advance of the meeting. 

#####  <a name="meeting-roles">Meeting Roles</a>
The Chair will assign the following rotating roles for each meeting:
- Facilitator - Introduces each agenda item. Monitors both the chat and the visual meeting window for “hands”, keeps track of order, and says whose turn it is to speak. Makes sure everyone has a chance to share their views.
- Notetaker - Records meeting attendance and major points of discussion. Especially takes note of decisions and action items.
- Timekeeper - Pays attention to the clock and notifies the group when time for specific agenda items is running short.

##### Meeting Minutes
The Secretary will use the written meeting notes to prepare official minutes, and post these minutes to the appropriate GitHub repository listed below:

- [Data Carpentry](https://github.com/datacarpentry/curriculum-advisors)
- [Library Carpentry](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors)
- [Software Carpentry](https://github.com/swcarpentry/curriculum-advisors)

Minutes should include: 
- Date and time of meeting
- Names of those in attendance
- Agenda items discussed and a summary of each discussion
- The outcomes of any votes taken

Minutes must be approved by Chair before posting.
