## The Carpentries Incubator Lesson Spotlight

The Incubator Lesson Spotlight is a regular feature in
The Carpentries blog and newsletter,
highlighting a lesson currently under community development.
The purpose of the Spotlight series is to raise the visibility of that lesson
among the broader community,
and to encourage community members to contribute to
the further development of that lesson.

Any lesson in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator] is eligible to be included
in the series, regardless of the stage of development that lesson is currently in.
It is a good way for lessons in the early stages of development
to attract new collaborators,
and for those in later stages
to invite others to informally review the lesson
and to try teaching the material.

**If you are a developer of a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator,
you can submit your lesson to be featured in
the series by filling in
[the Incubator Lesson Spotlight content submission form][ils-form]**.

In the form, you will be asked to provide
some basic details of the lesson and your collaborators,
some information about the objectives and the history of the lesson,
and a description of how The Carpentries community can best contribute
to its ongoing development.
This information will be used by the Core Team
to create a post for [The Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/),
an item for the [Carpentries Clippings newsletter](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/),
and related posts to social media.
When the blog post has been drafted,
a pull request will be opened to add that post to the website.
You will be tagged for a (optional) review of this pull request
before it is published.

Incubator Lesson Spotlight features are intended to raise the visibility of
the lesson and to encourage other community members to get involved in its
further development,
so it is best to think about how you can prepare your lesson for new contributors
before the feature is published.
This might mean labelling existing issues
(e.g. to appear on [the Help Wanted page][help-wanted])
or creating new ones,
making sure that your CONTRIBUTING.md is up-to-date,
and/or planning publication of the Spotlight feature to fit with a relatively quiet
period in your schedule so that you can respond promptly
to any new issues and pull requests.
