Email Subject Line: A Call to Action: Help The Carpentries Meet Our Fundraising Goal

Dear [potential donor’s name],

My name is [your name], and I am the [position or role] with The Carpentries. Our mission is to build global capacity in essential data and computational skills, and to help train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research.

This year has been a challenging one for us all. We understand the impact the global Coronavirus pandemic has on our community, and communities around the world as we shift to virtual instruction. We believe the importance of digital skills is undeniable; educators and organisations are collaborating to support effective instructional strategies, and with your help, The Carpentries is primed to thrive in this environment. Despite the unprecedented impact of the Coronavirus pandemic, our instructors have run even more Self-Organised workshops this year than we anticipated, teaching our established digital skills curricula globally, but our work is never finished and we want to do so much more.

The Carpentries supports more than 3,300 highly skilled instructors in communities in 66 countries across the world. We have experience training educators, researchers, librarians, and technologists. We are working to scale our instructor training and curriculum development programs to respond to the shift in the nature of education around the world. __Now more than ever we need you to champion our mission__. You can help us teach data skills to the communities that need them most by donating any amount you feel comfortable with.

__Our goal is to raise $5,000 in individual contributions by December 31, 2021. Will you help us get there?__

Donating even a small amount can make a big difference - we value all contributions. Your donation will allow The Carpentries to expand into new geographies and new disciplines, and will help bring workshops to individuals who might otherwise have barriers to participation.

If you are interested in supporting The Carpentries’ mission of teaching data skills globally, [please visit our campaign page](https://give.communityin.org/81tdn9?ref=sh_fAVdid_ab_aAUcRd) and donate any amount you are comfortable with.
Thank you so much!

Sincerely,  
[Your name]  
[Your role within The Carpentries]
