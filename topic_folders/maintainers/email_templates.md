#### Maintainer retiring

Subject: Thank you for your service as a lesson Maintainer with The Carpentries!

Dear {name},

Thank you for all of the work that you have done for The Carpentries community as a lesson Maintainer. Your service has been incredibly valuable to the community and to all workshop learners who have benefited from the high-quality lessons maintained by you and the rest of the Maintainer team.

You recently indicated that you would like to step down from the Maintainer role. To honor this request, I have removed you from the Maintainers private Slack channel and TopicBox list, as well as from the relevant GitHub team for your lesson. You are also no longer listed as a Maintainer on The Carpentries website. 

Please know that these changes are cosmetic and you have not lost your status as a trusted Maintainer for The Carpentries lesson materials. If at any point you would like to resume working as a Maintainer, please let me know or send an email to team@carpentries.org and we would be happy to reinstate you. 

I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and hope to continue seeing you around the community.

In service,
{name}

#### Inactive maintainer removal

Subject: Removal from maintenance team for LESSON NAME

Dear {name},

In MONTH YEAR you were certified as a Maintainer for the LESSON NAME. Not seeing any activity from you on that repository in the past TIME, I am assuming you no longer want to be part of the maintenance team for this lesson. 

You have been removed from the Maintainers private Slack channel and TopicBox list, as well as from the relevant GitHub team for your lesson. You are also no longer listed as a Maintainer on The Carpentries website. 

If at any point you would like to resume serving as a Maintainer, please let me know or send an email to team@carpentries.org.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and hope to continue engaging with you in The Carpentries community.

In service,

#### Notification that co-Maintainer has been removed

Subject: Co-Maintainer stepping down from LESSON NAME

Dear {name},

NAME has recently stepped down serving as a Maintainer for the LESSON NAME lesson, making you the sole acting Maintainer for this lesson. Our goal is to always have at least two active Maintainers for each lesson, and this lesson will be prioritized in the next round of recruitment for Maintainer Onboarding. In the meantime, please feel free to assign items to me for review and/or ping me in Slack or by email for anything you would like assistance with. MAINTAINER COMMUNITY LEAD (cc’d and @GITHUB HANDLE) is also available to provide some support as needed, in their role as Maintainer Community Lead. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for all that you do with and for The Carpentries community.
