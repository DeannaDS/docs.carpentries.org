## Carpentries in Africa

### What We Do

- **Monthly African Community Meetup**: Our monthly African Carpentries Community meetups have been running since 2017.

If you are keen to join please sign up at [our Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/ZA-community-call).

- **Mentoring for Instructors and Helpers before a workshop**: Some members of the African instructor community are willing to host online mentoring sessions for instructors and helpers before a workshop to ensure everyone knows what to expect and what is expected of them. If you are available to meet with an instructor/helper team before they run a workshop to answer any questions they may have or to help them prepare for the lessons they will be teaching, please get in touch via [our email](mailto:admin-afr&#64;carpentries.org) and we can pair you up with a team at a time and date that will suit you.

- Angelique van Rensburg works with  <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> as the Regional Consultant for Southern Africa, and is ready to help you with any questions you have about running **Carpentries workshops** or any other ways you can get involved with **The Carpentries in Africa**!

### CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 ###

6 - 17 September 2021

#### 2 weeks · 2 Carpentries Workshops · 1 Carpentries Instructor Training ·2 Networking + Learning Sessions · 1 Keynote ####


#### What is CarpentryConnect ZA 2021? ####

The main goal of CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 is to build capacity for workshops through instructor training, and establish a network for the regional Carpentries community.

CarpentryConnects are community convenings, organised to bring together community members of The Carpentries that are in close proximity geographically for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and networking.

[The first South African CarpentryConnect](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/01/carpentryconnect-jhb2018/) took place in Johannesburg, South Africa in September 2018. CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 will build on the successes of that first event, with an aim to bring together and grow the Carpentries community in South Africa even further.

The second South African CarpentryConnect will be held virtually and will bring together newer and more experienced community members to share knowledge, network, to develop new skills, and to develop strategies for building strong local communities around digital and computational literacy at universities in the country.

CarpentryConnect South Africa 2021 is designed for:
- current Carpentries community members based in Africa
- those looking to learn foundational coding and data science skills,
- those who would like to train and become Carpentries instructors,
- all interested in conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research.

### Historical support

The first Carpentries workshops in Africa were run in 2013 but it only really kicked off in 2015. An African Task Force was established in 2016, consisting of international mentors from the USA, UK, and Australia, and guided the first batch of trained African instructors through the checkout process as most of them were very isolated and new to the world of The Carpentries.

Since then more than 100 African instructors have participated in online or in-person instructor training events. The African Task Force was revived in December 2017, then completely consisting of African instructors. The task force played a role in mentoring instructors who had been trained but hadn’t qualified as well as qualified instructors who needed support before teaching a workshop. Small online sessions were hosted by task force members to demonstrate how various lessons are taught and to help solidify skills in the tools we teach. The second African Task Force finished its activities in December 2018. Some of the South African-based activities were funded through the Rural Campuses Connection Project II (RCCP II), which ended in March 2019. You can read more about the experiences of the African Task Force in this [blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/01/african-task-force-update/) and about RCCPII [here](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/).
