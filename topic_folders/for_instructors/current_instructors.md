## For Current Carpentries Instructors

### Professional Development for Instructors
As part of welcoming and orienting new Instructors to our community, and enriching and
building skills and community among continuing Instructors, we have a number of ways to support you.

### Mentoring and Development
The [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html)
(formerly known as the Mentoring Subcommittee) manages the mentoring program, which supports Instructors as they progress
through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities.

### Community Discussions
These hour-long sessions are organised by
the [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html) and
serve a number of purposes. Trainee Instructors use them as part of their checkout process. There they can raise questions about teaching workshops and other matters and get advice from more experienced Instructors. All sessions are run by volunteers. Instructors preparing to teach can attend to ask questions, get tips, and find useful examples or analogies they can use. Instructors who have recently taught can attend to debrief about what went well, and what might have gone better, so they can plan for next time. Sessions are coordinated through this [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

### Mentoring Groups
Mentoring is a professional development opportunity that The Carpentries offers our growing Instructor pool to help
community members learn and grow. Whether you are a new Instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned Instructor
hoping to run workshops in a new community, or an Instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance,
mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal. Mentoring
groups run in specified rounds at regular intervals. See
the [Mentoring Groups section](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/mentoring_groups.html) for more information.

### Carpentries Champions
If you are interested in building a local community, then consider joining
the [Carpentries Champions](https://pad.carpentries.org/champions). Champions calls
are run quarterly and you can hear from more experienced community members about what strategies
you can try to build grassroots communities. There is already
a [Carpentries Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/), with
‘recipes’ you can adapt for your local needs. There is a
[Champions mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/champions), and
you can also join the `#champions` channel on [Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

### Meetups page
If you are attending a conference or event and would like to network with other Carpentries community members,
please add the details of the event and your own details to our [meetups Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-events-meetup).

### Accessing and Updating Your Instructor Profile
