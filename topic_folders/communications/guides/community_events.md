### Signing up to Host or co-Host a Community Discussion

The Carpentries uses [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) to manage scheduling of Community Discussion sessions (these include Pre- and Post-Workshop Discussions, Themed Discussion Sessions and Carpentries Conversations).  This allows community members to schedule discussion sessions at times that are best for them, rather than requiring them to choose from a predefined schedule.  Four times a year, Discussion Hosts (i.e Pre- and Post Workshop Discussion Hosts, facilitators coordinating Themed Discussion Sessions and/or Carpentries Conversations) will be asked to slot in their availability. 

We enouage community members aiming to host Themed Discussion and/or Carpentries Conversations to make use of the [Calendly](https://calendly.com/thecarpentries) scheduling tool during the four times a year. This will allow The Carpentries Community Development Team to support your recruitment initiatives and help publicise your event. In the rare instance that you need to schedule such sessions outside of a quarter please complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSen9_axxQ3_0FN5HjL7cyot9RzTdIGpOU16Wr1eatZblsfU7w/viewform).

Once Discussion Hosts have scheduled themselves in for a Community Discussion session via Calendly, The Carpentries Core Team will ensure that these events appear on the [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) and on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).  

This system aims to build Community Discussion schedules around the Host availability.  The community of Discussion Session Hosts should represent a good cross-section of the general Carpentries community, and should offer the broader community a better option of sessions to attend.   

People interested in being Co-hosts can review the calendar once it is published, and sign up on the Etherpad to co-host an event of their choice.

#### Event Cancellations

We recognise that even after scheduling their own events, Discussion Hosts may have conflicts and may need to cancel a scheduled event. If this happens, the Host should contact community@carpentries.org as soon as possible so a Core Team member can ensure another Host is able to cover this event.
